# YouTube Redesign
Simplified theme redesign for YouTube :smile:.

The theme was originally made for myself, so it's pretty straightforward. But a few my acquaintance liked it, so I decided to share it on GitHub.

## Preview
You can find a preview of the theme in [Preview](https://github.com/decursus/yt-redesign/tree/master/preview) folder.
